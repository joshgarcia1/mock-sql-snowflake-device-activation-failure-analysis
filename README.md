# Device Activation Failure Analysis  
### *Mock Independent Data Analysis Project • SQL • Snowflake • Excel Visualization*

This project simulates a real-world Business Systems Analyst workflow by analyzing **3,000 POS device activation attempts** to identify patterns, root causes, and high-impact opportunities for product and engineering teams.

Using **Snowflake**, **SQL**, **Python**, and a visual **Excel spreadsheet**, the analysis surfaces key drivers behind activation failures and provides actionable business insights.
